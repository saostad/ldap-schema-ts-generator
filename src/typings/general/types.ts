It is possible that you would want to create a class that inherits from other classes and has certain attributes but that is not one you will ever need to create instances of directly. This type of class is known as abstract. For example, letâ€™s say that the Marketing-User and Finance-User were to be the first of a number of structural classes that had a common structure. In that case, you could create an abstract class to be used as the basis of other structural classes. Abstract classes can inherit from other classes, can have attributes defined on them directly, and in all other ways act like structural classes, except that instances of them cannot directly be created as objects in Active Directory.
 * - 3 for Auxiliary, meaning that a class that can be used to extend the definition of a class that inherits from it but cannot be used to form a class by itself. Auxiliary classes are a way for structural and abstract classes to inherit collections of attributes that do not have to be defined directly within the classes themselves. It is primarily a grouping mechanism. An auxiliary class can be a subclass of an abstract or auxiliary class. An auxiliary class can include any number of auxiliary classes in its definition.
